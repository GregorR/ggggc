GGGGC implements heavyweight features in branches, to avoid #ifdef hell. The
feature branches are:

default:
    Default options. No thread-safety or threading.

threads:
    Threadsafe, stop-the-world collector. Collection itself is not done in
    parallel, this branch just gives thread safety.

mthreadgc: (parent 'threads')
    Threadsafe, stop-the-world, parallel collector. Collection is not
    concurrent with mutation, but multiple GC threads are run simultaneously.


Currently there is one other branch, 'fythe'. The 'fythe' branch is the
implementation for Fythe, which adds support for Fythe's object model, JIT and
stack.
