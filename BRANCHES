GGGGC implements heavyweight features in branches, to avoid #ifdef hell. The
feature branches are:

default:
    Default options. No thread-safety or threading.

dynamicmemsize:
    Use OS-specific information to guess when to expand or contract the heap
    based on pagefaults. The additional complexity is small but convoluted, so
    it is kept separately.

threads:
    Threadsafe, stop-the-world collector. Collection itself is not done in
    parallel, this branch just gives thread safety.

mthreadgc: (parent 'threads')
    Threadsafe, stop-the-world, parallel collector. Collection is not
    concurrent with mutation, but multiple GC threads are run simultaneously.


Currently there is one other branch, 'fythe'. The 'fythe' branch is the
implementation for Fythe, which adds support for Fythe's object model, JIT and
stack.
