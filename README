GGGGC is a non-conservative generational copying garbage collector. Because
it's non-conservative, it is necessary to inform the garbage collector of every
pointer. This also means you must be very careful in C to not store pointers to
GC'd objects in temporary locations through function calls; in particular, do
not allow function arguments to be expressions returning pointers, always use
literals and get their values earlier.

There is basically no documentation right now, read ggggc.h and the tests in
tests/.
