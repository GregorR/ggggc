GGGGC is a non-conservative generational copying garbage collector. Because
it's non-conservative, it is necessary to inform the garbage collector of every
pointer. This also means you must be very careful in C to not store pointers to
GC'd objects in temporary locations through function calls; in particular, do
not allow function calls within function arguments, as those function calls may
yield and destroy your pointers.

There is basically no documentation right now, read ggggc.h and the tests in
tests/.
